# Demand-prediction
Through the combination of historical sales data and current data, data scientists are able to forecast future demand levels. They frequently make use of predictive analytics and machine learning to evaluate the factors influencing customer demand and their potential impact on the business.




There are several types of demand forecast:

Short-term It is is carried out for a shorter-term period of 3 months to 12 months. In the short term, the seasonal pattern of demand and the effect of tactical decisions on customer demand are taken into consideration.
Medium to long-term It is typically carried out for more than 12 months to 24 months in advance 36–48 months in certain businesses. Long-term Forecasting drives business strategy planning, sales and marketing planning, financial planning, capacity planning, capital expenditure, etc.
External macro-level This type of Forecasting deals with the broader market movements which depend on the macroeconomic environment. External Forecasting is carried out for evaluating the strategic objectives of a business like product portfolio expansion, entering new customer segments, technological disruptions, a paradigm shift in consumer behavior, and risk mitigation strategies.
Internal business level This type of Forecasting deals with internal operations of the business such as product category, sales division, financial division, and manufacturing group. This includes annual sales forecast, estimation of COGS, net profit margin, cash flow, etc.
Passive It is carried out for stable businesses with very conservative growth plans. Simple extrapolations of historical data are carried out with minimal assumptions.
Active  It is carried out for scaling and diversifying businesses with aggressive growth plans in terms of marketing activities, product portfolio expansion, and consideration of competitor activities and external economic environment.

1. Gather available data
In our case we have got the next datasets:

1. sales_train.csv — the training set. Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.
2. test.csv — the test set. You need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.
3. sample_submission.csv — a sample submission file in the correct format.
4.items.csv — supplemental information about the items/products.
5. item_categories.csv — supplemental information about the items categories.
6. shops.csv- supplemental information about the shops.
7. Briefly review the data structure, accuracy, and consistency. Let’s make several tables and plots to analyze our dataset.
